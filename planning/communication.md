## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
